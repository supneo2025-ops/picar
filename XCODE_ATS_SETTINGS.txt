  XCODE APP TRANSPORT SECURITY (ATS) SETTINGS
================================================================================

Problem: iOS app build fails with "Multiple commands produce Info.plist"
Solution: Add ATS settings directly in Xcode (no separate Info.plist file)

================================================================================
  WHY THIS HAPPENS
================================================================================

Modern iOS apps (iOS 14+) don't need a separate Info.plist file.
Xcode automatically generates one during build.

When you add a custom Info.plist file, Xcode tries to:
1. Use your custom Info.plist
2. Generate its own Info.plist

Result: Build error "Multiple commands produce Info.plist"

Solution: Remove the custom Info.plist and add settings in Xcode directly.

================================================================================
  FIX - ADD ATS SETTINGS IN XCODE
================================================================================

Step 1: Open Xcode Project
  cd /Users/hungnx/PycharmProjects/picar/ios-app/PiCar
  open PiCar.xcodeproj

Step 2: Select Target
  1. In Project Navigator (left panel), click "PiCar" (top blue icon)
  2. In center panel, select "PiCar" under TARGETS (not PROJECTS)

Step 3: Go to Info Tab
  1. Click "Info" tab (top of center panel)
  2. You'll see "Custom iOS Target Properties"

Step 4: Add App Transport Security Settings
  1. Hover over any existing property
  2. Click the "+" button that appears
  3. Select "App Transport Security Settings" from dropdown
     (Start typing "App Transport" to find it quickly)
  4. This creates a Dictionary entry

Step 5: Add "Allow Arbitrary Loads"
  1. Click the triangle next to "App Transport Security Settings" to expand it
  2. Hover over "App Transport Security Settings"
  3. Click the "+" button that appears
  4. Select "Allow Arbitrary Loads" from dropdown
  5. Change the value from "NO" to "YES"
     (Click on "NO" to change it to "YES")

Step 6: Add "Allow Local Networking"
  1. Hover over "App Transport Security Settings" again
  2. Click the "+" button
  3. Select "Allows Local Networking" from dropdown
  4. Change the value from "NO" to "YES"

Step 7: Add Local Network Usage Description
  1. Hover over any property at the root level (not inside a dictionary)
  2. Click the "+" button
  3. Type "Privacy - Local Network Usage Description"
     (Or select "NSLocalNetworkUsageDescription")
  4. Set the value to:
     "This app needs to connect to your Raspberry Pi car on the local network for video streaming and control."

Your Info tab should now show:

Custom iOS Target Properties
  ▼ App Transport Security Settings (Dictionary)
      Allow Arbitrary Loads (Boolean) = YES
      Allows Local Networking (Boolean) = YES
  Privacy - Local Network Usage Description (String) = "This app needs to connect..."

Step 8: Clean and Rebuild
  1. Product > Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
  2. Product > Build (Cmd+B)
  3. Product > Run (Cmd+R)

================================================================================
  VERIFICATION
================================================================================

After adding these settings:

1. Build should succeed (no "Multiple commands" error)
2. Run the app in Simulator or device
3. Check Xcode console for debug logs:

Expected logs:
  📹 [VideoStream] Loading MJPEG stream from: http://192.168.100.148:5000/video
  📹 [VideoStream] Stream task started
  📹 [VideoStream] Received response: <NSHTTPURLResponse>
  📹 [VideoStream] Status code: 200
  📹 [VideoStream] Content-Type: multipart/x-mixed-replace; boundary=frame
  📹 [VideoStream] Received 33789 bytes
  🖼️ [VideoStream] Decoded frame successfully
  ✅ [VideoStream] First frame displayed!

If you see these logs, the video stream is working!

If you see ATS error:
  ❌ [VideoStream] Error: App Transport Security has blocked...

Then the ATS settings weren't applied correctly. Go back to Step 3-7.

  COMMON ISSUES
================================================================================

Issue: Can't find "App Transport Security Settings" in dropdown
  → Type "App Transport" in the search/dropdown
  → It may be listed as "NSAppTransportSecurity"

Issue: Can't find "Allow Arbitrary Loads"
  → After expanding App Transport Security Settings, click + inside it
  → Type "Allow Arbitrary" in dropdown
  → It may be listed as "NSAllowsArbitraryLoads"

Issue: Can't find "Allows Local Networking"
  → Type "Local Networking" in dropdown
  → It may be listed as "NSAllowsLocalNetworking"

Issue: Build still fails with "Multiple commands produce Info.plist"
  → Check if Info.plist exists in project
  → If yes, remove it from the project:
    Right-click Info.plist > Delete > Remove Reference
  → Clean Build Folder and rebuild

Issue: Video still doesn't show
  → Check Xcode console for error messages
  → Make sure Pi server is running: ./restart_pi_server.sh
  → Test video in browser: open http://192.168.100.148:5000/video
  → Check you're on same network as Pi

================================================================================
  CURRENT PI SERVER STATUS
================================================================================

Server: ✅ Running (streaming 5850+ frames)
Video Endpoint: ✅ Working (tested with curl)
Camera: ✅ Active

Test commands:
  # Check server health
  curl http://192.168.100.148:5000/health

  # Test video stream
  curl http://192.168.100.148:5000/video | head -c 10000 | wc -c
  (Should return >1000)

  # View in browser
  open http://192.168.100.148:5000/video

If Pi server is not responding, restart it:
  ./restart_pi_server.sh

================================================================================
  SUMMARY
================================================================================

1. Removed custom Info.plist (causes build error)
2. Add ATS settings directly in Xcode Info tab
3. Three settings needed:
   - App Transport Security Settings > Allow Arbitrary Loads = YES
   - App Transport Security Settings > Allows Local Networking = YES
   - Privacy - Local Network Usage Description = (explanation text)
4. Clean Build Folder and rebuild
5. Video stream should work!

Pi server is ready and streaming - just need to configure Xcode properly.
