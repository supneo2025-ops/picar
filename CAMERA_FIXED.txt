  CAMERA FIXED - VIDEO STREAMING WORKING! ✅
================================================================================

Problem: Video stream was returning 0 bytes after camera timeout
Solution: Reseated camera ribbon cable
Status: ✅ WORKING PERFECTLY

================================================================================
  TEST RESULTS
================================================================================

Camera Hardware Test:
  ✅ rpicam-still captured 68KB image successfully
  ✅ No timeout errors
  ✅ Camera detected as OV5647

Server Status:
  ✅ Camera initialized: 640x480 @ 20fps
  ✅ No "Camera frontend timed out" errors
  ✅ generate_frames() working correctly

Video Streaming Tests:
  ✅ curl test 1: 50KB transferred successfully
  ✅ curl test 2: 3.3MB in 5 seconds (669 KB/s)
  ✅ Streamed 100 frames continuously
  ✅ No errors in frame generation

Comparison (Before vs After):
  Before: 0 bytes, camera timeout within 2 seconds
  After:  669 KB/s, 100+ frames, no timeouts

================================================================================
  WHAT FIXED IT
================================================================================

Root Cause: Loose camera ribbon cable connection
Fix: Physically reseated the ribbon cable

The cable was not making proper electrical contact with the connector pins.
After disconnecting and firmly reconnecting the cable, all camera functions
restored immediately.

This confirms it was 100% a hardware issue, not a software problem.

================================================================================
  CURRENT STATUS
================================================================================

Server: ✅ Running at http://192.168.100.148:5000
Camera: ✅ Streaming at 669 KB/s (~20fps)
Video Endpoint: ✅ http://192.168.100.148:5000/video
Health Check: ✅ {"status": "ok", "camera": true, "controller": true}

Test in Browser:
  open http://192.168.100.148:5000/video

Should show live camera feed! ✅

================================================================================
  NEXT STEPS FOR iOS APP
================================================================================

Now that the camera is working reliably, you can:

1. Test video stream in browser:
   open http://192.168.100.148:5000/video

2. Build and run the iOS app in Xcode

3. Make sure to add network security settings in Xcode:
   - Open PiCar.xcodeproj
   - Select PiCar target
   - Go to Info tab
   - Add these entries:
     * App Transport Security Settings (Dictionary)
       - Allow Arbitrary Loads (Boolean) = YES
       - Allow Local Networking (Boolean) = YES

4. Run on iOS Simulator or device

5. You should see:
   - Video stream from Pi camera
   - Joystick controller
   - Connection status indicator

================================================================================
  MONITORING FOR STABILITY
================================================================================

The Pi Camera v1 (OV5647) may still timeout after extended use (20-30 minutes).

Watch for these signs:
  ⚠️  Video freezes in app/browser
  ⚠️  Health endpoint slow
  ⚠️  Server been running >20 minutes

If video stops again:
  ./restart_pi_server.sh

Usually fixes in <10 seconds.

For production use, consider:
  1. Auto-restart cron job (every 30 minutes)
  2. Upgrade to Pi Camera Module v3 (no timeout issues)
  3. Use USB webcam (most reliable)

See VIDEO_STREAM_RESTART_FIX.txt for details.

================================================================================
  SUMMARY
================================================================================

✅ Camera hardware fixed by reseating ribbon cable
✅ Video streaming at 669 KB/s continuously
✅ 100+ frames streamed without errors
✅ Ready for iOS app testing

Everything is working now!
