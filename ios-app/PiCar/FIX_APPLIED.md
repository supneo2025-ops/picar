# Build Error Fixed! ✅

## Problem
Xcode was trying to copy Info.plist to two locations, causing a duplicate output error.

## Solution Applied
Removed the custom Info.plist file. Modern iOS apps (iOS 14+) don't need a separate Info.plist - settings go directly in the project configuration.

## ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Add Network Security Settings

You **MUST** add these settings manually in Xcode to allow HTTP connections to your Raspberry Pi server.

### Steps to Add Network Permissions

1. **Open Xcode** (if not already open):
   ```bash
   open ~/PycharmProjects/picar/ios-app/PiCar/PiCar.xcodeproj
   ```

2. **Select the PiCar project** in the Navigator (blue icon at top)

3. **Select the PiCar target** (under TARGETS, not PROJECT)

4. **Go to Info tab** (top menu: General, Signing, Info, Build Settings...)

5. **Add App Transport Security Settings:**

   Click the **+** button next to any existing key and add:

   ```
   Key: App Transport Security Settings
   Type: Dictionary
   ```

6. **Expand** the "App Transport Security Settings" and click the **+** to add child items:

   **First child:**
   ```
   Key: Allow Arbitrary Loads
   Type: Boolean
   Value: YES
   ```

   **Second child:**
   ```
   Key: Allow Local Networking
   Type: Boolean
   Value: YES
   ```

### Visual Guide

Your Info tab should look like this:

```
▼ App Transport Security Settings        Dictionary
  ▸ Allow Arbitrary Loads                 YES
  ▸ Allow Local Networking                YES
```

### Why This is Needed

- Your Raspberry Pi server runs on HTTP (not HTTPS)
- By default, iOS blocks non-HTTPS connections for security
- These settings allow HTTP connections to local network devices
- This is safe for local development and local network usage

## Alternative: Quick Fix for Testing

If you want to test immediately without changing settings:

**Temporary workaround:** The app will build and run, but WebSocket connections to HTTP servers will fail. You'll see connection errors but the UI will work.

**Proper fix:** Add the network settings above (takes 1 minute).

## After Adding Settings

1. **Clean Build Folder**: Product > Clean Build Folder (Cmd+Shift+K)
2. **Build**: Product > Build (Cmd+B)
3. **Run**: Product > Run (Cmd+R)

The build should now succeed! ✅

## Verify Settings Were Added

To verify the settings are correct:

1. Select PiCar target > Info tab
2. Look for "App Transport Security Settings"
3. Should show:
   - Allow Arbitrary Loads: YES
   - Allow Local Networking: YES

## Next Steps

After adding the network settings:

1. ✅ Build should succeed
2. ✅ Update server IP in WebSocketClient.swift
3. ✅ Run the app
4. ✅ Start test server: `./test_macos.sh`
5. ✅ Test connection

**Status:** Info.plist removed ✅
**Action Required:** Add network security settings in Xcode (see above)
**Time Required:** ~1 minute
